Description Your body depends on water to survive. Every cell, tissue, and organ in your body needs water to work properly. For example, your body uses water to maintain its temperature, remove waste, and lubricate your joints. Water is needed for overall health and wellness. This is especially so in hotter countries such as Singapore where I am stationed. Singapore is a small island nation located near the equatorial where the average temperature is around 30 degrees celsius. To beat the heat, we should drink more water to stay hydrated so as to avoid heat-related illness or injury. Whenever we see someone drinking water, why do we feel the urge to do the same, even if we are not thirsty? Mr.Hydrate is an example of a possible animated character to encourage us to drink water on a hot day with his eye-catching motion and warning light when the surrounding temperature rises above 30 degrees celsius.
