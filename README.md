Description: Have you ever wondered how connected you are? As technologies become more pervasive and precise, novel smart devices have increasingly permeate our everyday activities. The interfaces exposed by these new ‘smart things’ limit both human-computer and human-human interaction to a very narrow and unoptimized manner. Most of the time, we either we spend significant time figuring out these ‘smart’ technologies or the way we use them disconnects us from physical reality. This needs to change! Our vision is to humanize the technology, we want to design technologies that learn and adapt to us instead of the other way around. Currently, most robotic arms wired up to controllers which means no wireless control capabilities and are controlled by human input devices such as a joystick. What if you want to control multiple axis at one time, that means you must have multiple joysticks. Through design thinking we came up with many ways to solve the problem but we always went back to what users would want and therefore our solution is to implement a wireless form of communication and we concentrated on the user-experience. For certain applications, we have made our robotic arm to work up to a range of 2km with simple gestures. We decided to differentiate our gripper to what is already on the market. Currently, most of the grippers are gear based. One of the limitation to gear based gripper is that it is difficult to change the size of the grip due to the fixed gear size. Hence we conceptualise our so called “piston engine and vernier caliper inspired gripper”. This allows us to modify the the mouth of the gripper for different use cases.
